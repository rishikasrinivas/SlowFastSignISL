1648,1648,1648,LljUaUMMCdg--3, Recall our experiments with PCs of cloth in chapter 3 and also keep in mind that we generally use a tumbler to keep a liquid.
1649,1649,1649,LljUaUMMCdg--4," Therefore, would it not be silly if we were to make a tumbler out of cloth?"
1650,1650,1650,LljUaUMMCdg--5, Figure 4.2

1655,1655,1655,LljUaUMMCdg--100, These substances are insoluble in water.
1656,1656,1656,LljUaUMMCdg--101, Page 30 Water plays an important role in the functioning of our body because it can dissolve a large number of substances.

1719,1719,1719,HBQwzyxvkZA--105, Fish have slippery scales on their bodies.
1720,1720,1720,HBQwzyxvkZA--106, These scales protect the fish and also help in easy movement through water.
1721,1721,1721,HBQwzyxvkZA--107, We discussed in chapter 8.
1722,1722,1722,HBQwzyxvkZA--200, There are deserts.

1734,1734,1734,HBQwzyxvkZA--304, Roots normally play a very important role in the absorption of nutrients and water from the soil.
1735,1735,1735,HBQwzyxvkZA--305," However, in aquatic plants,"
1736,1736,1736,HBQwzyxvkZA--306, Roots are much reduced in size.
1737,1737,1737,HBQwzyxvkZA--307, and their main function is to hold the plant in place.
